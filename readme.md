# Spotify Playlist & Liked Songs Export/Import Script

This script allows you to export your **Spotify playlists and liked songs** to a JSON file and later import them to another Spotify account.

## Prerequisites

1. **Create a Spotify Developer App**
   - Go to the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/)
   - Click **Create an App**
   - Set an app name and description
   - Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** (you will use them in the .env file)
   - Under **Redirect URIs**, add http://localhost:8080
   - Click **Save**
   - **IMPORTANT:** Ensure that the user is registered under **User Management** (see Troubleshooting section below).

2. **Install Required Python Packages**

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Setup

### 1. Create a .env File

Create a .env file in the same directory as app.py and add the following:

```
CLIENT_ID='your_spotify_client_id'
CLIENT_SECRET='your_spotify_client_secret'
EXPORT_USERNAME='your_spotify_export_username'
IMPORT_USERNAME='your_spotify_import_username'
ERASE_USERNAME='your_spotify_erase_username'
REDIRECT_URI='http://localhost:8080'
```


### üîç Where to Get These Values?

- **CLIENT_ID** and **CLIENT_SECRET**  
  Found in your [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/) under your created app.

- **EXPORT_USERNAME / IMPORT_USERNAME / ERASE_USERNAME**  
  These are your Spotify account usernames. You can find them in your Spotify profile or by following [this guide](https://community.spotify.com/t5/FAQs/What-s-a-Spotify-username/ta-p/5286512).

- **REDIRECT_URI**  
  This should match the redirect URI added in your Spotify app settings (typically: `http://localhost:8080`).

## Usage

Run the script using the Python module execution flag (`-m`) followed by the package path (`src.main`) and the desired action flag.

### Export Data
This will fetch all playlists and liked songs from the **exporting account** (defined by `EXPORT_USERNAME` in `.env`) and save them to `spotify_data.json` (or the file specified by `--data-file`).

```sh
python -m src.main --export
```

### Import Data
This will read the data file (`spotify_data.json` by default) and add the playlists and liked songs to the **importing account** (defined by `IMPORT_USERNAME` in `.env`).

```sh
python -m src.main --import-data
```

### Erase Data
This will erase **ALL** playlists and liked songs from the **erasing account** (defined by `ERASE_USERNAME` in `.env`). **Use with extreme caution!** You will be prompted for confirmation.

```sh
python -m src.main --erase
```

### Options

#### Enable Debug Mode
Use `--debug` to get detailed logging information, including API call details and timing.

```sh
python -m src.main --export --debug
```

#### Clear Cache Before Running (**Recommended**)
Using `--clean-cache` will remove the cached authentication token for the specified user before execution. This is useful if you encounter authentication issues or switch users frequently.

```sh
python -m src.main --import-data --clean-cache
```

#### Specify Data File
Use `--data-file` to specify a different JSON file path for exporting or importing.

```sh
python -m src.main --export --data-file my_backup.json
python -m src.main --import-data --data-file my_backup.json
```

### Combined Usage Example
You can use multiple flags together:

```sh
python -m src.main --export --debug --clean-cache --data-file custom_export.json 
```

This will:
- Remove the cached authentication token for the `EXPORT_USERNAME`.
- Export data to `custom_export.json`.
- Provide detailed debug logs.

## Additional Notes
- The script requires **authorization** when running for the first time.
- Make sure the Spotify Developer app is correctly set up with the required **scopes**.
- The export/import process may take a while depending on the number of playlists and songs.

## Installing Dependencies
Ensure you have the required dependencies installed using the requirements.txt file:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Contents of requirements.txt:

```
spotipy==2.23.0
python-dotenv==1.0.0
requests==2.31.0
```

### Troubleshooting

#### **403 Forbidden Error**:
- Ensure the Spotify Developer app has the correct **Redirect URI** set (http://localhost:8080).
- Make sure your **account is registered** as a user in the Developer Dashboard under "Users and Access."
- Delete the .cache file if the token is invalid and try again:

  ```sh
  rm -rf .cache*
  ```

#### **User Not Registered Error**:
If you encounter an error like:

```
Check settings on developer.spotify.com/dashboard, the user may not be registered., reason: None
```

You need to **register the user in the Spotify Developer App**:

1. Go to the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/).
2. Open your **Spotify App**.
3. Navigate to **Edit Settings** ‚Üí **User Management**.
4. Add the user in the following **key-value format**:
   
   ```
   username:email
   ```
   
   Example:
   ```
   myspotifyusername:myemail@example.com
   ```
5. Click **Save**.

After completing these steps, try running the script again.

If you encounter further issues, refer to the [Spotify Web API documentation](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) or open an issue in your project repository.
